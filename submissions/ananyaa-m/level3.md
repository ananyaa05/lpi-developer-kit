# Level 3 Submission — Ananyaa M

### Agent GitHub Repository
https://github.com/ananyaa05/ananyaa-personal-twin-agent

### LPI tools referenced
The agent queries the official LPI methodology tools using real Inter-Process Communication (IPC) to the Node.js MCP server:
* `smile-overview`: Returns baseline framework and safety hazards.
* `query-knowledge`: Returns search results for methodology best practices.
* `get-case-studies`: Returns past failure metrics.
* `smile-phase-detail`: Returns specific emulation gaps.

### Setup Instructions
1. Ensure the `lpi-developer-kit` repository is located in the same parent directory as this agent repository.
2. Ensure Ollama is installed and running locally (`ollama serve`).
3. Clone the agent repository.
4. Run the agent using Python with a concept argument: `python agent.py "I want to build a digital twin of Amity University's CSE lab"`

### Evidence of explainability
The agent implements Explainable AI (XAI) using a two tiered provenance system to ensure the user always understands the reasoning behind every critique:

1. The system prompt enforces strict citation rules. The LLM is forced to begin every critique with the exact tool citation (e.g., `[SOURCE: LPI/smile-overview]`).
2. Every execution concludes by exposing a hardcoded `PROVENANCE` trace log to the terminal, mapping exactly how the raw data influenced the architectural audit.

MISSING REALITY REPORT
==================================================
[SOURCE: LPI/smile-overview] Critique 1: [Analysis of safety hazards based on SMILE framework guidelines]
[SOURCE: LPI/query-knowledge] Critique 2: [Analysis of manual override constraints]
[SOURCE: LPI/get-case-studies] Critique 3: [Analysis of potential failure metrics]
==================================================

==================================================
PROVENANCE - Every critique traced to its LPI source:
[1] Tool: smile-overview     -> Sourced baseline architectural safety hazards.
[2] Tool: query-knowledge    -> Sourced specific manual override constraints.
[3] Tool: get-case-studies   -> Sourced past failure metrics.
[4] Tool: smile-phase-detail -> Sourced sensor implementation gaps.
==================================================

### Security and Error Handling
* Used relative directory referencing (subprocess) to connect directly to the real Node MCP server, completely bypassing WinError 267 path errors without relying on mock APIs.
* Utilizes Regex (re) to sanitize user inputs to prevent commandline parsing errors and injection vulnerabilities.
* Implements try-except blocks to handle Ollama connection downtime gracefully without crashing the pipeline.
